# Better Scrollbar

Better Scrollbar is a simple browser extension that customizes the appearance of scrollbars for a cleaner and more modern look. It dynamically adjusts the scrollbar track color based on the website's background color and applies a custom style to the scrollbar thumb.

## Features
- Custom scrollbar styling with smooth, rounded corners.
- Dynamically detects and applies the background color of the website.
- Lightweight and runs efficiently without affecting performance.
- Works on all websites.

## Installation
1. Download the extension files.
2. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The extension is now installed and running!

## How It Works
- The script detects the website's background color and applies it to the scrollbar track.
- The scrollbar thumb color is set to a light gray (`#b1b1b1`), with a darker shade on hover.
- The extension uses CSS and JavaScript to apply these styles dynamically to all websites.

## Permissions
This extension uses the `<all_urls>` permission to apply styles globally to all pages.
